							<p>Alex team helped to prepare video for Looksery Kickstarter campaign. He assembled production team, together we developed the script and then shot the video. The shooting was well organized, production progress went quickly, so we were very happy with final results. The video was picked up and aired on TV by CNN and major TV channels in different countries. It also appeared online on Forbes, Business Insider, Techcrunch, Inc and many other media.</p>
							<p>We continued our cooperation for over a year. Alex team was shooting video for presentation of Looksery on the B2B market. His team did great job in presenting our company and product features in the best light and helped in acquisition of Looksery for 150M$.</p>

							<p>Alexandr shot a video about the opening of the Apple hardware museum in MacPaw office. Our cooperation resulted in a smooth and flawless process: from script writing to final voiceover editing. Alexandr and his team were exceptionally good at communication, video production, and even the office cats taming! Happy to see the Museum video featured on Mashable, AppleInsider, CultofMac and other popular media.</p>

							<p>We spent 2 weeks of intensive preparation, storyboarding and coordination together with Alex before we even began filming the commercial.Alex was on the same wavelength as us and we had a certain synchronicity with him which helped us bring the ideas we had to life in visual form. In the end, working with, or better yet, creating with production team was a great experience and the finished product speaks for itself. We at Lix Pen, highly recommend Pitcher Video because of their professionalism, flexibility, and quality of work they delivered for us.</p>
